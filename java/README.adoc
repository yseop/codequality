This document's goal is to show how to enforce the Yseop Code Style (based on http://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html[Google's guidelines]).

== Prerequisite

To be able to use the Yseop check style and formatter, you must first clone this repository (git@github.com:yseop/codequality.git) to have access to the files.

== Eclipse CheckStyle Plugin

First, you need to install the http://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs/#!/[CheckStyle Plugin] (drag and drop the [red]`install` button into your Eclipse workspace window, to trigger the installation).

* Once this is done, go to `Window -> Preferences -> CheckStyle`.

You'll see a list of two already existing configurations (Google and Sun):

* Click on `New` and in the new window select `External Configuration File`.
* Put the name [red]`Yseop Code Checks` (the name is important) in the `Name` box, then click on `Browse`, and select [red]`codequality/java/codeChecks/Yseop_Code_Checks.xml`.
* Then click on `Set as default`, and finally, `Apply and Close`.

Eclipse will prompt you about rebuilding the projects, select `Yes`.

If you already are on a branch from an Yseop project, the checkstyle environment configuration will be automatic.

You should now see the code style 'errors' highlighted in your editor.

== Eclipse Formatter

To try and fix these 'errors', you need to add a code formatter to Eclipse:

* Go to `Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Formatter`.
* Click on `Import`, and select [red]`codequality/java/codeFormatter/Yseop_Code_Formatter.xml`.
* Apply and Close.

To make sure the formatter will be used by each of your project:

* Right click on a project's root folder, select `Properties`.
* Go to `Java Code Style -> Formatter`, and make sur the `Enable project specific settings` box is *_not_* checked.

Now to format your code, you can use the `Ctrl + Shift + F` shortcut in any Java file. It also works if you select a specific line.

== Save Actions

To be sure not to forget to format your code, you can set a `Save Actions`, a set of actions that will be triggered each time you save a modification in your code.

* Go to `Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Save Actions`.
* Tick the `Perform the selected action on save` box.
* Then tick the `Format source code` box, and make sur the `Format all lines` option is selected.
* Also tick the `Organize imports` box. This will be discussed in the following chapter.
* Tick the `Additional Actions` box.
* Click on `Configure â€¦`. Within the tab `Code Style`, check the box `Use blocks in if/while/for/do statements` (leave `always`)
* Click Ok, Apply and Close.

To make sure the save actions will be the same for each of your projects:

* Right click on a project's root folder, select `Properties`.
* Go to `Java Editors -> Save Actions`, and make sure the `Enable project specific settings` box is *_not_* checked.

== Imports

Imports organization is also important for a standardized code style:

* Go to `Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Organize Imports`.
* Rearrange the import in alphabetical order, for example :
** `com`
** `java`
** `javax`
** `org`
* Make sur the `Number of imports needed for .\*` and `Number of static imports needed for .*` are set to 99.
* Apply and close.

To make sure the imports organization will be the same for each of your project:

* Right click on a project's root folder, select `Properties`.
* Go to `Java Code Style -> Organize Imports`, and make sur the `Enable project specific settings` box is *_not_* checked.

You can now reorganize your imports by using `Ctrl + Shift + o`, or by just saving a modification, thanks to the save actions.
