== Context

This document was initiated during the kustomize migration from `3.8.0` to `5.4.3` as a guideline for the transition.

Once the migration is complete the content of this document should be updated to reflect `5.4.3` guidelines instead.

| This is the target for `5.4.3` but fails for multi-documents in `3.8.0`.
In case of an error, fallback to the `transition syntax`.
